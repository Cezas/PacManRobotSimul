# PacManRobotSimul
Simulated environment for the robot for the Pac-Man Robot competition.
This program will be used to test the algorithm for the competition, and will possibly be implemented into the robot itself.

As of 12/28/2016, a basic display representing the grid has been established, and the hierarchy of entities are being worked on.  
BFS has also been completed, and will be used in the algorithm which has yet to be realized.  A* algorithm may be used once the
robot fully maps out all tiles for better pathfinding.


As of 11/23/2016, the program is still in early shape, as no algorithm has been implemented as of yet, 
no display has been established, and the hierarchy of objects still hasn't been completed.  I also have to study for finals, so
that's definitely going to delay this.
