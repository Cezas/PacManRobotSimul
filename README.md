# PacManRobotSimul
Simulated environment for the robot for the Pac-Man Robot competition.
This program will be used to test the algorithm for the competition, and will possibly be implemented into the robot itself.

As of 11/23/2016, the program is still in early shape, as no algorithm has been implemented as of yet, 
no display has been established, and the hierarchy of objects still hasn't been completed.  I also have to study for finals, so
that's definitely going to delay this.
